# Adoption Journey {{version}}

What are the considerations before adopting GitOps? (to avoid disaster or bad taste)

1. Start small
2. Consider the right skill set at the start of the journey (i.e. Basic understanding of software development lifecycle (SDLC) because GitOps is a software driven target operating model (TOM))
3. Container orchestration (e.g. Kubernetes (K8s)) has to be on the roadmap - how do we get ready for that (i.e. Start with infrastructure, then network)
4. Matrix view of crawl / walk / run (i.e. Independent deployability, Rapid application deployment)
5. Enablement strategy - Git enablement, Configuration Management (e.g. Kustomize) enablement, DevSecOps enablement
6. Standardisation (i.e. Choose a standard from the options in Argo CD and Flux to structure your repositories)
7. Champions / Community of Practice (CoP) - a team that can 'go first'
8. Executive sponsor
9. Automation maturity - Infrastructure as Code at the minimum
10. Communication strategy (Why are we doing this, how does it fit our context, how will we manage risks?)
